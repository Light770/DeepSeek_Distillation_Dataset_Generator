# Contributing to Open-R1: Getting Started Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines concrete steps to contribute to the Open-R1 project, which aims to reproduce and open-source the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1.

## Phase 1: Dataset Generation and Distillation
### Getting Started
1. Set up your development environment:
   - Python 3.8+
   - Access to DeepSeek-R1 API or alternative reasoning models
   - Git for version control
   - Sufficient storage for dataset collection

### Key Tasks
1. Generate reasoning datasets:
   - Implement data collection scripts for various domains
   - Focus on math, logic, and analytical problems
   - Ensure proper documentation of data generation process
   - Include verification steps for quality control

2. Dataset Validation:
   - Create validation scripts to ensure data quality
   - Implement metrics for reasoning step coherence
   - Document validation methodology

## Phase 2: Training Pipeline Development
### Prerequisites
1. Computing Resources:
   - Access to GPU clusters or cloud computing
   - Storage for model checkpoints
   - Environment for distributed training

### Key Tasks
1. Implement RL Training Pipeline:
   - Develop reward modeling systems
   - Implement Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
   - Create evaluation metrics

2. Fine-tuning Pipeline:
   - Implement supervised fine-tuning infrastructure
   - Develop multi-stage training processes
   - Create checkpoint management system

## Phase 3: Model Evaluation and Improvement
### Tasks
1. Benchmark Development:
   - Create comprehensive evaluation suites
   - Implement automated testing pipelines
   - Document performance metrics

2. Model Analysis:
   - Study scaling laws
   - Document compute/performance trade-offs
   - Analyze model behaviors across different domains

## How to Contribute
