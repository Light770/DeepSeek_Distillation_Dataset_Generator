    "problem": "Alice can paint a house in 6 hours, Bob in 8 hours, and Charlie in 12 hours. They start working together. Alice leaves after 1 hour, Bob leaves 2 hours later. Charlie finishes the job. If they split $900 based on work done, how much does each get?",
    "step_by_step": "1. Calculate hourly work rates:\n   - Alice: 1/6 house per hour\n   - Bob: 1/8 house per hour\n   - Charlie: 1/12 house per hour\n\n2. First hour (all three working):\n   Combined rate = 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 3/8 house per hour\n   Work done = 3/8 \u00d7 1 = 3/8 of the house\n\n3. Next 2 hours (Bob and Charlie working):\n   Combined rate = 1/8 + 1/12 = 5/24 house per hour\n   Work done = 5/24 \u00d7 2 = 5/12 of the house\n\n4. Remaining work after 3 total hours:\n   1 - (3/8 + 5/12) = 1 - 19/24 = 5/24 of the house\n\n5. Charlie working alone:\n   Time needed = (5/24) \u00f7 (1/12) = 2.5 hours\n\n6. Total work contributions:\n   - Alice: 1/6 \u00d7 1 = 1/6 \u2248 16.67%\n   - Bob: 1/8 \u00d7 3 = 3/8 = 37.5%\n   - Charlie: 1/12 \u00d7 5.5 = 11/24 \u2248 45.83%\n\n7. Payment distribution:\n   - Alice: $900 \u00d7 1/6 = $150\n   - Bob: $900 \u00d7 3/8 = $337.50\n   - Charlie: $900 \u00d7 11/24 = $412.50",
    "final_answer": "Alice: $150, Bob: $337.50, Charlie: $412.50",
    "confidence": "10/10",
    "verification": "1. Total payment verification: $150 + $337.50 + $412.50 = $900\n2. Work contribution verification: 1/6 + 3/8 + 11/24 = 4/24 + 9/24 + 11/24 = 24/24 = 1 house\n3. Time calculations match remaining work requirements"
